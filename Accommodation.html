	<h2>Cork Road College Campus</h2>
	<p>Located inside WIT's Main Campus on Cork Road, Waterford. This is often recommended
		for first years as it feels more safer as it located inside
		the Main Campus at WIT. Therefore students of this course would only need to walk
		to their lecture's building outside their doors. Students will have their own single
		room, while sharing the apartments's kitchen and sitting room. It has great
		security with CCTV system and a live in warden. It also offers services such as a
		laundry facility. 
	</p>
	 <p>Spaces are very limited, if you want a room you need to deposit
		€300. Students can pay for a room per semester, from Sept - Dec and Jan - May. Don't worry, you 
		can cancel it but make sure its not too late. The total payment for semester one is around
		€2,500 while semester 2 is €3,000 (Single Room). Students can pay this in monthly installiments if they wish.
	    We recommend checking out the offical WIT website in relation for applying for a room 
		as they have the officals forms to apply. Click on this link below for more information.

	<h2>City Campus</h2>	   
	<p>Located near the heart of Waterford City. It is also a 15th minute walk from the main
	   campus on Cork Road. This place is ideal for anyone doing a course in the
	   College Street Campus and for 2nd, 3rd and 4th year students. This is a much bigger
		complex than the other accommodation. City Campus has simular services like the one
		on Cork Road but has advantages. Such as being a 10 minute walk into the city's shops and
		deluxe ensuite bedrooms. Like the cork road campus, payment needs a deposit of €300 for 
		booking a room. A single room on city campus for semester 1 is around €2,400 and semester 2
		is €2,900. For more information, we recommend the offical WIT website, where you can apply
		for a room and find extra information.
