		<h2>What is it?</h2>
		
		<p>This is a three year fulltime undergraduate course. Students are taught various
		skills that they can use within the sport and business industries. What is Recreation
		and Sports Management? Recreation is people playing sports but is less competitive and
		is seen more as a relaxing activity but still fun for everybody involve. Making it less
		stressful physically and mentally. 
			
		This course allows students to learn how to oragnise
		leisure events and be in a role of a couch. For example, organising a sports day for 
		children in the local parish. However, there is also subjects that teaches students how
		to be a personal trainer inside the gym, which can be more competitive if the person
		they are working with are proactive in sports such as boxing or soccer. </p>
		
		<p>As for the businness side of the course, it is more related to the sports industry. 
		Which can make the business more engaging for the students. Students are taught subjects 
		such as accounting, hr and economics. This opens the door for work in 
		either the sport and businness industries, or even both.
		
		In this course, students will work on these subjects in two buildings in Waterford City.
		For lectures, where students sit inside and take notes while the lecturer or teacher is 
		teaching the class. This will be done in the Tourism & Leisure Building on WIT Main Campus,
		Cork Road, Waterford City, Co. Waterford. For practicals, where the students will be working 
		on their skills taught from the lectures. This will be done in the WIT Arena on Carriganore, 
		Co. Waterford
